This is a website of a "coding" themed quiz.
* The instructions appear once you open the page
* The "start quiz" button starts the quiz, starting the 60 second timer and showing the 5 questions on by one.
* The "next" button locks in the answer for that question and moves on to the next question.
* once the timer is up, or all the questions are answered, there is a label where the user can input their initials.
* these initials will be saved into localStorage and appear at the end of the next quiz.
* after submitting your initials, you will be prompted to the previous highscore log. 
* to restart the quiz the user may refresh the page or click the "go back" button.
* to clear localStorage and the highscore log, click "clear highscores"
